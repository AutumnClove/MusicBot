Small update to address a few issues.  I was going to release this with the next major update but i'm going to push this much now to fix a few things.

### Fixes
- Fixed `requirements.txt` entries (discord.py, cffi)
- The restart loop now only happens after a certain point during the bot startup sequence
- Updated comments in example configs

### Additions
- If the bot is a `Bot` account, it will display the invite url in the console if the bot is not in any servers on startup
- Songs can now be skipped by whomever queued them.
